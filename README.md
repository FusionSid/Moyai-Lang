# :moyai: Lang

Wanted to make my own language/compiler so i'm making this  
Currently it supports math expressions and printing them  
It has 4 datatypes String, int, float and char.  
As of now its an interpreted language but once i figure it out it will be a compiled lang

### Usage:

```bash
make
./main.out <filename>
```
